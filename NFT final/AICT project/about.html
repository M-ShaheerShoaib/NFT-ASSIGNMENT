            <p> Dreamers is a limited-edition NFT collection by Dubai-based digital artist and art director Yugal Odhrani,
      exploring the intersection of fashion, technology, and dystopian aesthetics. Launched in November 2021, 
      the collection comprises 44 meticulously handcrafted 3D portraits, each representing a unique avatar 
      that embodies resilience and imagination in a speculative future world.</p>

            <h2>Concept And Themes</h2>
            <p>At its core, Dreamers reflects Odhrani’s fascination with human anatomy, fashion, and the emotional depth of digital characters. 
      The collection envisions a world where individuals don minimalist garments designed to address complex global challenges, symbolizing 
      survival and adaptability in a dystopian environment. Each avatar serves as a narrative piece, inviting viewers to explore new ideas 
      and technologies within a reimagined world.</p>

        <div class="section style">
            <h2>Artistic Style And Influences</h2>
            <p> Odhrani’s work is characterized by a blend of surrealism and realism, drawing inspiration from classical art and contemporary fashion. 
      His digital portraits convey a range of human emotions—despair, eccentricity, and authenticity—through detailed facial expressions and body language. 
      This fusion of traditional artistic elements with modern digital techniques positions Odhrani as a notable figure in the NFT art space.</p>
